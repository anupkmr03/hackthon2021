# Remember to blink! Take an Eye Care break.

This VS Code extension helps you to keep reminding to give a break to your eyes. That helps to prevent dry eyes issues. 

With dry eye becoming a global epidemic, especially for people who sit in front of a computer screen all day, it is important to take care of the health of your eyes.  Blinking is the #1 way to keep your eyes from becoming too dry.  The goal of the project is to build a VS (Visual Studio) Code extension that has a feature to show a pop-up-based reminder to blink.  This extension will only be available for users of VS (Visual Studio) Code, however the long term goal is to offer this to more users through other apps.  The overall reminder setting will be customizable and it will offer a pop up page with some useful exercise for the eyes.
